@title bert
@doc An updated Erlang BERT encode/decoder, based on Tom Preston-Werner's bert.erl. This library uses maps instead of dicts, so requires Erlang/OTP R17 and higher.

BERT (Binary ERlang Term) is a flexible binary data interchange format based on (and compatible with) Erlang's binary serialization format (as used by erlang:term_to_binary/1).
